## Pre requisite

You need to have these installed on your machine :

- docker engine
- docker compose
- psql

## Objective

You have been contacted by the maintainer of this application to improve the performances of the page `/carousel`. The maintainer notices that, after a rewrite of the website, there are little to none visitors. It impacts the revenue of its shop.

Your goal is to analyze the webpage to spot what could lead to its poor performances, how would you fix them, and try to fix them.

The application has been written in PHP with Symfony 7 and is using Tailwindcss. It pulls data from a postgresql database.

Everything is hosted on a singular VPS, which has 2 CPU cores and 2Go of RAM. The VPS is located in Canada (North America).

You only have access to the application source code and the database. You don't have access to the server that host.

### Notation

#### Analysis document /10

- intro
  - why performance is important
- hypothesis
  - what is wrong with the application
- tests and measurements
  - what metrics confirm your hypothesis
  - what tools you will use to measure/test
- solutions
  - what immediate programming solutions could fix the application
- conclusion
  - new measurements to confirm your solutions
  - what could be done in the future to improve the performances again

#### Programming fixes /10

The pull request containing the programming solutions you chose to do in your analysis document. 

## Installation

```bash
# Step 1 : download the project

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/optimization-php

cd optimization-php

# Step 2 : initialize the docker containers

docker compose up -d --build

docker compose exec optimization-php composer install

# Step 3 : initialize the database

docker compose exec optimization-php bin/console d:d:c

psql postgres://postgres:password@localhost/guitareboissieres -f app/var/db.sql
docker exec -i postgres psql -U postgres -d guitareboissieres < app/var/db.sql
# Step 4 : start the web server

docker compose exec optimization-php php -S 0.0.0.0:8000 -t public/
```

Your application should now be live at `http://127.0.0.1:8888/carousel`
